Jupyter notebook plagiarism detector project in Sagemaker using Pytorch model

# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a fully functional project to be able to process a list of source
documents and answer documents and determine if the answer documents have been plagiarised from the source documents.

# Here are some steps to be able to run this project in the Sagemaker environment in AWS
1. This project is built to be run in a Jupyter notebook within the AWS environment.  You will have to make sure to have a valid AWS account
2. Once you have a registered account, you should go and search in the "Services" menu for Sagemaker
3. Once in Sagemaker, you can create a new Jupyter notebook and this will give you the option to clone this repository
4. When the Notebook instance gets fully created, and the notebook is ready to be opened, the source for this repository will be availble for you to run within the AWS console.
